## What's different about engine.js?

+ You don't need to run a complicated build system just to get your app to run in a web browser.

In fact, you don't need to a build process at all. engine.js is written in JavaScript that is supported natively by browsers all the way back to IE9. It's also compatible with AMD and require.js right out of the box. And if you want to, you can still use popular transpilers like Browserify, Webpack, and Babel.

+ It's tiny.

engine.js is _2.5kb_ gzipped.

React is _34.8kb_ gzipped.

Vue is _20.9kb_ gzipped.
